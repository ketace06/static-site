"We help to Create Brands With Coffee!"

Zebb is a creative static website concept designed to help users build coffee-based brand identities. Inspired by a Figma model, it showcases a pixel-perfect layout using only HTML and CSS ‚Äî no JavaScript required.

Zebb is my first completed website project.

This project enabled me to strengthen my design skills and deepen my mastery of HTML and CSS development. It also taught me to better structure ideas and transform concepts into functional interfaces (animations, links, etc.). This website is based on a Figma model and gives me the ability for pixel-perfect structuring (or the nearest). It provides me a better perception of CSS (which is mostly used), using grid, flexbox, :root (for variables) and many more bases. Although I've made basic CSS, I reached a better understanding of Git and GitHub systems that allows me to commit and push some features. For example, implementing a new section or deleting codes that are unconventional, etc. And checked all the tasks of each section.

Without using Javascript, I've done an entire website that is fully usable and can be improved with dynamic implementations.
